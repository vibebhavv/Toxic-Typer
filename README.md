# Objective
***Toxic Typer*** is modified version of [***BDSMTyper***](https://github.com/viperadnan-git/bdsm-typer) (Thanks to original creator) I modified BDSMTyper to make the UI more interactive and added a bit more of functionality.

The new added feature is for ***codetantra-sea*** as because as what i noticed that if you run typer first and then codetantra-sea the typer works but you have to close the codetantra application and then copy the content again which is time consuming. So the new feature allows you to copy multiple content and then paste them.

## How to Use
To install the Typer just run below command and to use the typer it's just simple as the previous on, but slight change now you can copy multiple content and paste them even when the typer is running in background.

Just use LCTRL + Left/Right Arrow (Left to Right logic) and press the set shortcut key.

```
git clone https://github.com/vibebhavv/Toxic-Typer
cd Toxic-Typer
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```

For Executable install **pyinstaller** module using `pip3 install pyinstaller` and just run `install.bat` and you will find an executable file in **dist folder**.
